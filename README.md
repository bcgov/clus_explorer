## Caribou and Land Use Simulator Explorer Application
### Description and Usage
The Caribou and Land Use Simulator (CLUS) is a spatial, large-scale analytical model for simulating forest harvest and it's potential influence on other forest values (e.g., wildlife habitat). More details on the CLUS model can be found [here](https://github.com/bcgov/clus).

The CLUS Explorer Application was designed to visualize and describe outputs from the CLUS model. When using the CLUS model to analyze a forest harvest scenario, you can access the application to compare and contrast the outcomes for various forest values (e.g., timber supply, caribou habitat, etc.).

### Getting Help or Reporting an Issue
We've developed a [Wiki page](https://github.com/bcgov/clus/wiki) to help you with understanding the structure and functions of the CLUS model. We are also working on a [tutorial](https://github.com/bcgov/clus/blob/master/documentation/clus_quick_start_tutorial.md) that will describe the steps to get a basic CLUS model up and running. 

If you find any errors with the code, please submit them via the github  ["Issues"](https://github.com/bcgov/clus/issues) tab.

For more information on working with the CLUS team to use the CLUS model for a forest management problem, please contact Tyler Muhly (tyler.muhly@gov.bc.ca), Acting Team Lead, Strategic Analysis, Forest Analysis and Inventory Branch, Office of the Chief Forester, Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development.

### Requirements
The model is coded using the R programming language. Thus, you will need to [download program R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) to work with the code. We also recommend downloading the free version of [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), which provides a nice integrated development environment for working with R.
